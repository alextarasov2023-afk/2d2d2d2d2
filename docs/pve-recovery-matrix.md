# PvE recovery matrix

This file tracks the source evidence used by the Minecraft 26.2 port.
`Recovered` means the relevant behavior is present in executable recovered
bytecode. `Partial` means recovered methods are mixed with non-executed stubs.
`Manual` marks behavior reconstructed from settings, cross-references, state
transitions, protocol behavior, and neighboring recovered methods.

Existing Blade features are extended rather than duplicated:

- AutoTool: add normal/silent selection modes needed by mining bots.
- ChestStealer: expose reusable selective-loot transactions.
- AutoTotem: retain the current implementation and expose bot pause state.
- AutoRespawn: add delay and post-respawn command support.
- AutoTpaAccept: add friends-only and PvP guards.
- AutoClicker/NoDelays: add missing active-click and XP-bottle-only behavior.

Every manually reconstructed branch must have a deterministic state-transition
test or parser test before the corresponding feature is considered complete.
